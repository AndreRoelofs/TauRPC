# TauRPC

This package is a Tauri extension to give you a fully-typed RPC layer for [Tauri commands](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/features/command/). 
The TS types corresponding to your pre-defined Rust backend API are generated, so they can be consumed by your Typescript frontend framework of choice.
